# üè¶ CFPB Credit Card Complaints Analysis | Python + Tableau
Data-driven insights into consumer complaints, company responses, and dispute patterns

## üìä Project Overview

This project analyzes consumer complaints data from the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)** to uncover insights into:
- How financial companies handle consumer complaints
- Response efficiency and timeliness
- Dispute trends across different companies and products

As a **Data Analyst**, the goal was to clean, prepare, and analyze the dataset to answer key business questions and visualize insights using Python and Tableau.

## üíº Business Problem Statement

The **CFPB** and partner companies want to understand how effectively consumer complaints are being managed and resolved.

They‚Äôve asked for:
1. An overview of total complaints and complaint categories  
2. Identification of top issues and products with the most complaints  
3. Timeliness of company responses and average resolution time  
4. Insight into consumer disputes ‚Äî how often customers are unsatisfied  
5. Complaint submission trends over time (daily, monthly, by channel)

The main question:  
> ‚ÄúWhich companies are receiving the most complaints, how are they responding, and are customers satisfied?‚Äù

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)** ‚Äì Data cleaning, KPI computation, and visualizations  
- **Tableau** ‚Äì Dashboard design and advanced data storytelling  
- **Excel** ‚Äì Data inspection and initial exploration  
- **GitHub** ‚Äì Version control and project documentation

## üóÇ Dataset Overview

**Source:** Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) public dataset  
**Rows:** 2M+ complaints  
**Columns:** 23 fields including company, product, issue, state, complaint narrative, date received, and timely response flag.

**Key Columns:**
| Column | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| company | Name of the financial institution |
| complaint_id | Unique ID for each complaint |
| product | Product category (e.g., credit card, mortgage) |
| company_response_to_consumer | How company responded |

| date_sent_to_company2 | Date complaint was sent to the company |


## üßº Data Cleaning Process

Steps performed in Python:
- Removed duplicate records  
- Standardized column names  
- Parsed and formatted date fields  
- Calculated response time (days between received and sent dates)  
- Created flags for ‚ÄúTimely Response‚Äù and ‚ÄúDisputed Complaint‚Äù  
- Filtered invalid or missing complaint entries

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Total Complaints Overview**  
   *Shows the total complaints received and rolling 12-month trend*  
   
#### Code Snippet (Total Complaints, Rolling 12 Months)
```python
# Total Complaints
total_complaints = credit_df.shape[0]
print("Total Complaints:", total_complaints)

# Rolling 12 Months
# Convert date column
credit_df['date_received'] = pd.to_datetime(credit_df['date_received'], errors='coerce')

# Define 12-month rolling window
max_date = credit_df['date_received'].max()
rolling_start = (max_date - pd.DateOffset(months=11)).replace(day=1)

rolling_df = credit_df[
    (credit_df['date_received'] >= rolling_start) &
    (credit_df['date_received'] <= max_date)
]

rolling_12m_complaints = rolling_df.shape[0]

print(f"Rolling 12-month window: {rolling_start.strftime('%b %Y')} ‚Üí {max_date.strftime('%b %Y')}")
print(f"Rolling 12-month complaints: {rolling_12m_complaints:,}")
```

| Top Complaint Issue | Most frequent issue raised | Mode(`issue`) | Identify recurring problems |


## üí° Key Insights

1. **High Complaint Volume:** Top 3 companies account for over 40% of total complaints.  
2. **Response Timeliness:** ~88% of complaints were responded to on time.  
3. **Disputed Rate:** About 7‚Äì10% of consumers disputed company resolutions.  
4. **Submission Channels:** Most complaints were submitted via Web, showing customer preference for online engagement.  
5. **Daily Trends:** Noticeable spikes during certain months ‚Äî may align with product releases or financial events.

## üß≠ Recommendations

- Focus on **improving dispute handling** ‚Äî analyze reasons for disputes in narratives.  
- Enhance **timely response tracking** through automated alerts.  
- Prioritize customer experience for **top complaint products** (like credit cards and mortgages).  
- Use complaint channel insights to **optimize support staffing** (e.g., more agents online).
